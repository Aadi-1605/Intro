💻 2nd Year **CSE student** @ DY Patil International University, Akurdi  
☕ Currently surviving on **Java, DSA, SQL & Git**  
🐍 Fluent in **Python**, can talk in **C/C++** too  
⚡ Mission: turn *“college assignments”* into *actual projects*

## 🚀 My Coding Journey
- Started off writing `printf("Hello World");` in C  
- Got curious → learned Python 🐍  
- Tried C++ (because everyone said *“real programmers use it”*)  
- Now grinding DSA + SQL + Java like there’s no tomorrow

## 🛠️ Toolbox
- **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java  
- **Concepts:** DSA, Databases (SQL)  
- **Gear:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA  
- 🧑‍🔧 Superpower → *debugging at 2AM and pretending I understand recursion*

## 🌱 Current Mood
- Solving DSA problems (and sometimes creating them 😅)  
- Building discipline & consistency 🏋️  
- Breaking and fixing code until it works

## 🎓 Education
- **B.Tech in Computer Science** – DYPIU, Akurdi  
- **Class 11 & 12 (Science)** – Podar International
